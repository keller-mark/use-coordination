## About use-coordination

Coordinated multiple views (CMV) is a technique developed in the field of information visualization.
CMV enables different visualizations, or _views_ more generally, to be linked on arbitrary subsets of properties.

`use-coordination` is a JavaScript library for implementing CMV in React-based visualization systems.

## Why do I need a library?

Of course CMV is straightforward to implement using React alone by "lifting state" and using prop drilling.
However, use-coordination provides several benefits:
- Based on a coordination model from the information visualization literature
- Entire coordination space is serializable to a JSON representation
- Uses Zustand store internally to avoid the need for prop drilling across views
- React hook-based API to simplify developer mental model (not event-based)
- Provides an object-oriented API for construction of JSON specification
- Supports multi-level coordination allowing for coordination of hierarchical state
- Supports meta-coordination allowing for storing coordination scope mapping in the coordination space
